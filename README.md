# titanic-survivor-solution

Well, my first ever Machine Learning problem-solving experience.
The Titanic dataset - predicting survival of the passengers on board - by Kaggle. It was a great experience. I had to go through many blogs, pdfs and videos because I was doing hands-on ML coding for the first time. 

To explain my journey I did the following things:-
1. Read the training and test data from excel

2. Tried understanding the data and using intuition to predict which features are useful and if new features are required or no.

3. Then I did data pre-processing

4. Next, I did features mapping and make things ready for my algorithms.

5. Then I used my data against the following algorithms:-
  a. #StochasticGradientDescent (SGD) algorithm

  b. #RandomForestClassifier algorithm

  c. #LogisticRegression algorithm

  d.  #KNearestNeighbours (KNN) algorithm

  e. #GaussianNaiveBayes algorithm

  f. #Perceptron algorithm

  g. #LinearSupportVectorMachine (SVM) algorithm

  h. #DecisionTree algorithm

6. While calcualting, I have used K Fold clustering to shuffle the data and then find average accuracy. Also, mean and standard deviation was calculated and taken into consideration for deciding which algorithm to use.

7. Then I compared the accuracy and identified that Random Forest Classifier was giving me good accuracy.

8. Then I calculates the % contribution of each feature to the accuracy. Thus, dropped 2 features.

9. Again I have calculated the accuracy. Though it didn't add much to the accuracy but was a good practice to do.

One must solve problems given on Kaggle.
